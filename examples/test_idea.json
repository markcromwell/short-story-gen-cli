  "expanded": "Detective Elara Vance's ability to hear others' thoughts has always been her greatest asset and deepest burden, but when she wakes to find her own body at a crime scene, the familiar mental landscape of her city has gone silent. Her power, once a tool for justice, now flickers erratically, failing her when she needs it most. She must navigate a labyrinth of her own memories and the fragmented thoughts of potential suspects—her estranged partner, a vengeful witness, and a shadowy figure who knew her darkest secret—while realizing the killer might be someone she trusted implicitly, or worse, someone who manipulated her ability to orchestrate her death. The stakes are existential: if she can't prove she's alive and identify the murderer, she'll fade from reality entirely, becoming a ghost in the very mind she could once command.",
