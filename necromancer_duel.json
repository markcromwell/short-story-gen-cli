  "raw_idea": "Two necromancers fight to the death over the same love in a weird science fantasy setting. Inspired by Clark Ashton Smith's baroque, decadent style with archaic language, cosmic horror, and dying earth aesthetics. Include: ancient sorcery, forbidden love, grotesque transformations, eldritch dimensions, and the macabre beauty of decay. The story should have Smith's trademark ornate prose, dark romanticism, and blend of science and sorcery.",
  "one_sentence": "In the crumbling, airless city of Veridian, where clockwork angels rust in the dead sun and the very stones whisper of entropy, two necromancers, Elara the Bone-Singer and Silas the Gilded Crypt-Weaver, duel with cursed relics over the corpse of their shared beloved, their desperate love unraveling the fabric of reality into a screaming chasm of eldritch decay.",
  "expanded": "The battle unfolds upon the obsidian dais of the Aethelian Mausoleum, its vaulted ceiling choked with fossilized starlight. Elara, her form half-fused with the skeletal remains of her beloved Lyra, commands bone-lace and shadow-stitched whispers, while Silas manipulates the decaying clockwork of Lyra's preserved heart, a fusion of arcane science and necromantic artifice. Each spell they cast—a bloom of phosphorescent fungi from Lyra's ribs, a cascade of grinding gears from her chest cavity—wrecks the city further: streets fracture into dimensional rifts, the air thickens with the scent of ozone and rot, and the very light of Veridian’s dying sun bleeds into the void. The city, a tomb for a dead civilization, groans as their conflict tears at its fragile magic, threatening to consume all remaining life in a cataclysm of decaying matter and screaming voids.",
